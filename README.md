RoastBot 9000

RoastBot 9000 is an AI chatbot demonstrating advanced persona engineering. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and the Gemini API, this project uses strict system prompts to lock the AI into a "roaster" personality. It deflects all standard queries, showcasing the power of controlled generative AI responses.

(Recommendation: Replace the placeholder above with a real screenshot of your app!)
